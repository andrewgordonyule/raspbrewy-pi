# Raspbrewy-Pi

Temperature automation tool for home brewing wine / kombucha using a Raspberry Pi.

## Equipment Used:
* Raspberry Pi (Model 2 B V1.1)
* <a href="https://camjam.me/?page_id=623" target="_blank">CamJam Edukit #2 Sensors / Thermometer</a>
* Breadboard and wires
* <a href="https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/product/ENER002-2PI" target="_blank">Energenie ENER002-2PI Remote Control Sockets with RPi Transmitter</a>
* RPI GPIO Expansion Board
* Heating Pad with mains power lead

## Background

I've been trying to brew wine at home but often ran into problems with fermentation slowing down / stopping due to fluctuating temperatures. I wanted to build an automation tool using a Raspberry Pi to switch on / off a heating pad depending on a thermometer reading.

## Notes

There are probably much more effective approaches for homebrew temperature control using heat insulation jackets, temperature controlled heating belts, or using an Arduino based brewing system - but this project put that dusty Raspberry Pi in my desk drawer to good use, and displays a sweet graph!
